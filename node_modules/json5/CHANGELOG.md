### v0.5.1 [[code][c0.5.1], [diff][d0.5.1]]

[c0.5.1]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.5.1
[d0.5.1]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1

This release includes a minor fix for indentations when stringifying empty
arrays.

- Fix: Indents no longer appear in empty arrays when stringified. ([#134])


### v0.5.0 [[code][c0.5.0], [diff][d0.5.0]]

[c0.5.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.5.0
[d0.5.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0

This release includes major internal changes and public API enhancements.

- **Major:** JSON5 officially supports Node.js v4 LTS and v5. Support for
  Node.js v0.6 and v0.8 have been dropped, while support for v0.10 and v0.12
  remain.

- Fix: YUI Compressor no longer fails when compressing json5.js. ([#97])

- New: `parse` and the CLI provide line and column numbers when displaying error
  messages. ([#101]; awesome work by [@amb26].)


### v0.4.0 [[code][c0.4.0], [diff][d0.4.0]]

[c0.4.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.4.0
[d0.4.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.2.0...v0.4.0

Note that v0.3.0 was tagged, but never published to npm, so this v0.4.0
changelog entry includes v0.3.0 features.

This is a massive release that adds `stringify` support, among other things.

- **Major:** `JSON5.stringify()` now exists!
  This method is analogous to the native `JSON.stringify()`;
  it just avoids quoting keys where possible.
  See the [usage documentation](./README.md#usage) for more.
  ([#32]; huge thanks and props [@aeisenberg]!)

- New: `NaN` and `-NaN` are now allowed number literals.
  ([#30]; thanks [@rowanhill].)

- New: Duplicate object keys are now allowed; the last value is used.
  This is the same behavior as JSON. ([#57]; thanks [@jordanbtucker].)

- Fix: Properly handle various whitespace and newline cases now.
  E.g. JSON5 now properly supports escaped CR and CRLF newlines in strings,
  and JSON5 now accepts the same whitespace as JSON (stricter than ES5).
  ([#58], [#60], and [#63]; thanks [@jordanbtucker].)

- New: Negative hexadecimal numbers (e.g. `-0xC8`) are allowed again.
  (They were disallowed in v0.2.0; see below.)
  It turns out they *are* valid in ES5, so JSON5 supports them now too.
  ([#36]; thanks [@jordanbtucker]!)


### v0.2.0 [[code][c0.2.0], [diff][d0.2.0]]

[c0.2.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.2.0
[d0.2.0]: https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0

express data more easily:
